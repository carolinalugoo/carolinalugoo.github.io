    <h1>Carolina Lugo</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi! My name is Carolina Lugo and I'm currently a student at the University of Miami. I had always dreamed of traveling the world and visiting places I once could only imagine. From a very young age, I studied French, continuing my lessons through high school and college, which fueled my dreams of one day moving to Paris. This past semester, I had the priveledge of studying abroad in Paris where I made lifelong friendships and explored some of the most increadible places.</p>

    <h2>Paris</h2>

    <p>Paris, the City of Lights, was my home base. My time in the city filled me with so much love and joy. I have so much appreciation for Paris and the countless experiences and memories it brought. For 5 months I lived in the vibrant 20th arrondissement with my roommate Aylin, who is also a student at the University of Miami. Though we didn't know each other before being paired as roommates, we quickly became best friends. Despite our different majors—Aylin in a pre-med track and me in a pre-law track—we discovered we had a lot in common. We both loved exploring, traveling, trying out new restaurants, visiting museums, and had a shared passion for fashion, which was a big reason why we chose to study in Paris. As the semester progressed, so did our friendship, and I'm so grateful that studying abroad brought me one of my lifelong best friends. </p>

    <h2>London</h2>

    <p>London was one of my favorite cities I got to visit during my time abroad. we got so lucky during our time there and had perfect weather all weekend long. Traveling there was alos one of the shortest trips we had to make since it was only a 2 hour train ride there. I got to visit one of my best friends from home who was studying abroad in London at the University of Westminster. We had the most amazing time and she got to show me around some of her favorite places such as:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Borough Market</li>
    <li>Tower of London</li>
    <li>St. James's Park</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Belgium</h2>
    <p>Although short our time in Belgium sure was sweet. We got walk around the gorgeous city, try belgian waffles and fries which are a must, and go into a chocolate factory for a test tasting!</p>

    <h2>Italy</h2>
    <p>Famous for their food, art, and rich history Italy for sure lived up to the high expectations I had for it. since there so many places in Italy that we wanted to visit we chose to go during our spring break. Some of my favorites were the following:</p>
