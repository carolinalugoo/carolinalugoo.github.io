<p> Hi! My name is Carolina Lugo and I'm currently a student at the University of Miami. Last semester I had the priveledge of studying abroad in Paris. During the semester I made some of my best friends and got to visit the most increadible places.</p>
<h2>Paris</h2>

<p>My home base was the city of lights Paris, France. I have so much love for Paris and the experiences and memories that the city gave me. I lived in 20th arrondissement with my roommate Aylin who is also a student at the University of Miami! </p>

</ul>
