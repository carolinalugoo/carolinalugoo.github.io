    <section id="Introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations. It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing then President Charles DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO.</p>

      <p>Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities — French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion — became French regions and were made part of France proper.</p>

      </p>
      <p>note: two major future acquisition programs for the French military included the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System, or FCAS (known in France as the système combat aérien du futur, or SCAF) and a next-generation tank development project with Germany known as the Main Ground Combat System, or MGCS

      <figcaption>The Eiffel Tower is located in the heart of Paris and is the tallest structure in the city. Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair. The wrought-iron lattice tower is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. At 324 m (1,063 ft) tall it is about the same height as an 81-story building, and measures 125 m (410 ft) on each side. The Eiffel tower provides visitors with not only an incredible view of Paris, but also restaurants and shops. (<em>Photo by: The World Factbook 2021.

    <figcaption>The Palace of Versailles, built by King Louis XIV, is located 19 km (12 mi) west of Paris, France. The Hall of Mirrors is the largest room in the Palace. Seventeen mirror arches (each containing 21 mirrors and thus totaling 357 mirrors in the hall) face 17 windows that overlook the palace gardens. In this hall on 28 June 1919 the Treaty of Versailles was signed. The Treaty was one of the most important of the peace treaties ending World War I five years after it began. The treaty formally ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers.(<em>Photo by: The World Factbook 2021.
